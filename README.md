# Neural Network for Sequence Data

This project is an example how the recent advancements in Neural Networks
can be applied to sequence data, namely DNA.

We will take a collection of sequences plus information if they are 
bound by a transcription factor as input data and after training
a convolutional neural network we will be able to make predictions 
for new sequences. In addition we will extract what the network learned
and make a plot of the motif.

## Libraries

To run the the IPython Notebook you need:

* Jupyter / IPython
* Keras
* Theano89

All of them can be installed with the following commands:

```Shell
$ conda install ...
```
